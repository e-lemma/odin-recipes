    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A basic omelette is given an indulgent twist with rich clotted cream and sweet crabmeat.</p>
    <p>It feels special, but couldn't be simpler to make.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15g/½oz unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 free-range eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp clotted cream</li>
        <li>50g/1¾ oz Parmesan, finely grated (or vintage Cornish Gouda if you have it)</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz white crab meat: 100g/3½oz white crab meat</li>
        <li>50g/1¾oz brown crab meat</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh herbs (mix of parsley, chives, chervil and tarragon)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter in a medium frying pan and add the shallot. Fry for 2 minutes, until softened.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the clotted cream. Stir in the Parmesan, crab meats, herbs, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When the shallots are soft, pour in the egg and crab mixture. Reduce the heat to low and, using a spatula, occasionally draw in the sides as they start to set. While the egg is still wobbly and soft, flip one side of the omelette over the other to form a semi-circle.</li>
        <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate, cut in two and serve each half with a side salad and bread.</li>
    </ol>
